# Delay-SDE-net

This repository contains the Delay-SDE-net together with some run examples. The repository is under construction.

The Delay-SDE-net was introduced in Eggen and Midtfjord (2023). It is  a neural network model based on stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs), a generalization of the the SDE-net presented in Kong et al. (2020).
